Titanic Data Analysis

Overview

This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the infamous maritime disaster. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.

Objective

- Identify key survival predictors (e.g., sex, age, class).
- Compare model performance on classification accuracy.
- Understand dataset biases and missing data patterns.

Key Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed raw Titanic dataset.
- Performed detailed EDA with visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib).

Key Findings

- Gender played a significant role in survival — females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Passenger class (Pclass) and fare were strong indicators — higher-class passengers had better survival chances.
- Age was a contributing factor — children had a higher chance of survival.
- Passengers with smaller families tended to survive more compared to those traveling alone or with large families.

Conclusion

The analysis revealed that gender, class, and age were the most important features affecting survival.
